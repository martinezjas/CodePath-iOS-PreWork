## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- I like to use the Apple Music app as it has backgrounds that change along with the album art and is responses to the beat of the music.
- I like to use the CityTransit app as it allows me to easily choose my favorite stations and have their wait times displayed on the home screen for the MBTA system.
- I like to use the Bobby app as it allows me to keep track of my subscriptions and color codes them based on their category.

## Notes

- I really didn't have much trouble making this demo as the instructions were clear enough to follow. There were some instances where I got lost, but after some clicking around, I was able to find the right place to be.
